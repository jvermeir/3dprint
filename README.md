## plankje

Plankje is a small board with two ridges in a V form, intended to hold a mobile phone. Holding the phone this way makes it easier to read. 

`plankjeV2.scad` was created with [OpenScad](https://www.openscad.org/).
OpenScad can convert the .scad file to `plankjeV2.stl` which can then be used as input for [Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/) so it can be printed.
